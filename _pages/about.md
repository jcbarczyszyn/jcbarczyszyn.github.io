I would like to warn you of something important - at least for me. If all goes well, in the future, I will change my name from _Júlio Cândido Veloso Júnior_ to _Júlio Cândido Veloso Barczyszyn_. But, I'm already using "barczyszyn" as part of all my users in social media. That's it.
{: .notice}

I'm an undergraduate student in Mathematics and Scientific Computing at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) interested in research areas such as Logic, Category Theory, Operator Algebras and Foundations of Physics. Nowadays, I'm studying foundations of scientific theories under orientation of [Prof. Jonas Arenhart](https://fil.cfh.ufsc.br/jonas-becker-arenhart/) and Stone Duality under orientation of [Prof. Luiz Cordeiro](http://mtm.ufsc.br/~cordeiro/). 

## More about me

Despite being an undergraduate student in Mathematics, I took many extra courses involving areas such as Philosophy, Physics and Linguistics. Among the classes I attended, for example, are Metalogic, Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Physics, Methods of Mathematical Physics, Semantics, etc.

In addition to activities at the university, I write about Mathematics, Philosophy and Foundations of Science, with an special emphasis on the Foundations of Physics, on my blog [Fundamentae](http://fundamentae.com) (in Portuguese).

## Research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Logic, Formal Methods and Mathematical Philosophy:** development of Logic and Formal Methods and its applications in Philosophy and Science in general.
* **Stone-type dualities and its applications:** clarifications, generalizations and applications of the relations between algebraic and geometric/topological structures through Category Theory. 
* **Operator Algebras and Mathematical Physics:** C*-algebras, mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics and related mathematical problems in contemporary Physics.  
* **Philosophy and Foundations of Physics:** investigations on the nature of scientific theories, in the context of Physics, from a logical and philosophical point of view.

## Short CV

My education trajectory until now is:

* **B.Sc. in Mathematics and Scientific Computing at UFSC (2018-current)**
  * Emphasis in Logic and Mathematical Physics. 

* **Advanced Program in Mathematics at UFSC (2018-current)** 
  *  Honours course including Introductory Analysis, Linear Algebra and Calculus on Manifolds.
