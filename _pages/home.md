I'm an undergraduate student in Philosophy at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics.

Mostly of what I try to do could be called [Mathematical Philosophy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/meta.12029), namely, the study of philosophical problems or scientific problems with foundational aspects using both philosophical methodology and logical methods (or, more broadly, mathematical methods).

Nowadays, I'm studying foundations of scientific theories under [Prof. Jonas Becker Arenhart](https://fil.cfh.ufsc.br/jonas-becker-arenhart/)'s supervision and Stone Duality under [Prof. Luiz Cordeiro](http://mtm.ufsc.br/~cordeiro/)'s supervision.

Also, I write about _foundations_ on my blog [Fundamentae](http://fundamentae.com).

## Research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Philosophy of Science:** syntax-semantics debate, equivalence of scientific theories;
* **Foundations of Physics:** logical and philosophical investigation of physical theories;
* **Operator Algebras:** C*-algebras, mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics;
* **Dualities:** Stone-type dualities and other bridges between algebra and geometry;

## Short CV

My education trajectory until now is:

* **B.Sc. in Philosophy, UFSC (2024-current)**
  * Emphasis in Philosophical Logic and Philosophy of Science.

* **B.Sc. in Mathematics, UFSC (2018-2023)**
  * Emphasis in Mathematical Logic and Mathematical Physics.
  * Monograph: "Dualidade de Stone: uma odisseia lógico-matemática".
  * Completed the [PAM honors program](http://pam.mtm.ufsc.br/).

And here are some of my current academic/professional activities:

* **Undergraduate research project in Logic and Foundations of Science, UFSC (2023-current)**
  * This research is being funded by the [PIBIC/CNPq undergraduate program](http://pibic.propesq.ufsc.br/).
