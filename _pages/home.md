I'm an undergraduate student in Philosophy at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics. 

Regarding my research interests, they mainly center around Logic, Philosophy of Science and Physics. 

In general, I'm interested in (how to) address some philosophical problems, and scientific problems with foundational taste, employing both philosophical methods and logical methods (or, more broadly, mathematical methods). This approach is sometimes referred to as [Mathematical Philosophy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/meta.12029). 

Specifically, I'm studying logical foundations of scientific theories under [Prof. Jonas Becker Arenhart](https://fil.cfh.ufsc.br/jonas-becker-arenhart/)'s supervision and Stone-type dualities under [Prof. Luiz Cordeiro](http://mtm.ufsc.br/~cordeiro/)'s supervision.

At times, I blog about these things at [Fundamentae](http://fundamentae.com).

## Research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Foundations of Physics:** logical/philosophical investigations of physical theories;
* **Philosophy of Science:** syntax-semantics debate, equivalence of scientific theories;
* **Operator Algebras:** C*-algebras, mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics;
* **Dualities:** Stone-type dualities and other bridges between algebra and geometry;

## Short CV

My education trajectory until now is:

* **B.A. in Philosophy, UFSC (2024-current)**
  * Emphasis in Philosophical Logic and Philosophy of Science.

* **B.Sc. in Mathematics, UFSC (2018-2023)**
  * Emphasis in Mathematical Logic and Mathematical Physics.
  * Final project: "Dualidade de Stone: uma odisseia lógico-matemática".
  * Supervisors: Prof. Luiz G. Cordeiro, Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart.
  * Completed the [PAM honors program](http://pam.mtm.ufsc.br/).

And here are some of my current academic/professional activities:

* **Undergraduate research project in Logic and Foundations of Science, UFSC (2023-current)**
  * This research is being funded by the [PIBIC/CNPq undergraduate program](http://pibic.propesq.ufsc.br/).
  * Title: tba
  * Supervisor: Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart.
