I'm a Mathematical Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/), namely, I'm an undergraduate student in Philosophy with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics interested in logical methods (or, more broadly, mathematical methods) and their applications to philosophical problems, scientific problems with foundational aspects, or even mathematical problems. 

Nowadays, I'm studying foundations of scientific theories under [Prof. Jonas Becker Arenhart](https://fil.cfh.ufsc.br/jonas-becker-arenhart/)'s supervision and Stone Duality under [Prof. Luiz Cordeiro](http://mtm.ufsc.br/~cordeiro/)'s supervision.

## More about me

While as an undergraduate student in Mathematics, I took many extra courses involving areas such as Philosophy, Physics and Linguistics. Among the classes I attended, for example, are Metalogic, Philosophy of Physics, Methods of Mathematical Physics, Quantum Computing, Semantics, etc.

In addition to activities at the university, I write about _foundations_, with a special emphasis on the Foundations of Physics, on my blog [Fundamentae](http://fundamentae.com).

## Research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Dualities:** Stone-type dualities and other categorical relations between algebra and geometry;
* **Operator Algebras and Mathematical Physics:** C*-algebras, mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics and related mathematical topics in Contemporary Physics;
* **Philosophy and Foundations of Physics:** investigations on the nature of scientific theories, in the context of Physics, from a logical and philosophical point of view;
* **Philosophy and Foundations of Science:** aspects of the _syntax-semantics debate_ and criteria for establishing the equivalence of scientific theories;



## Short CV

My education trajectory until now is:

* **B.Sc. in Philosophy, UFSC (2024-current)**
  * Emphasis in Philosophical Logic and Philosophy of Science.

* **B.Sc. in Mathematics, UFSC (2018-2023)**
  * Emphasis in Mathematical Logic and Mathematical Physics.
  * Completed the [PAM honors program](http://pam.mtm.ufsc.br/).

And here are some of my current academic/professional activities:
