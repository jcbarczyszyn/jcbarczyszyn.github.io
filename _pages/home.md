I'm an undergraduate student in Philosophy at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics.

Most of the topics that interest me are related to Logic, Philosophy of Science and Physics. More specifically, I'm studying how to approach (some) philosophical problems, or scientific problems with foundational taste, employing both philosophical methods and logical methods (or, more broadly, mathematical methods), a.k.a., [Mathematical Philosophy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/meta.12029).

Nowadays, I'm studying foundational questions about scientific (mainly physical) theories under [Prof. Jonas Becker Arenhart](https://fil.cfh.ufsc.br/jonas-becker-arenhart/)'s supervision and operator-theoretic aspects of Quantum Theory's formalism under [Prof. Luiz Cordeiro](http://mtm.ufsc.br/~cordeiro/)'s supervision.

Also, I write about _foundations_ on my blog [Fundamentae](http://fundamentae.com).

## Research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Dualities:** Stone-type dualities and other bridges between algebra and geometry;
* **Philosophy of Science:** syntax-semantics debate, equivalence of scientific theories;
* **Operator Algebras:** C*-algebras, mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics;
* **Foundations of Physics:** logical/philosophical investigation of physical theories;

## Short CV

My education trajectory until now is:

* **B.Sc. in Philosophy, UFSC (2024-current)**
  * Emphasis in Philosophical Logic and Philosophy of Science.

* **B.Sc. in Mathematics, UFSC (2018-2023)**
  * Emphasis in Mathematical Logic and Mathematical Physics.
  * Monograph: "Dualidade de Stone: uma odisseia lógico-matemática".
  * Completed the [PAM honors program](http://pam.mtm.ufsc.br/).

And here are some of my current academic/professional activities:
