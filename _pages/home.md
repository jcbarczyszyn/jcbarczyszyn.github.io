I'm an Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics. I like to think that what I do is _Mathematical Philosophy_, namely, the study of logical methods (or, more broadly, mathematical methods) and their applications to philosophical problems and scientific problems with foundational aspects. 

Nowadays, I'm studying foundations of scientific theories under [Prof. Jonas Becker Arenhart](https://fil.cfh.ufsc.br/jonas-becker-arenhart/)'s supervision and Stone Duality under [Prof. Luiz Cordeiro](http://mtm.ufsc.br/~cordeiro/)'s supervision.

## More about me

While as an undergraduate student in Mathematics, I took many extra courses involving areas such as Philosophy, Physics and Linguistics. Among the classes I attended, for example, are Metalogic, Philosophy of Physics, Methods of Mathematical Physics, Quantum Computing, Semantics, etc.

In addition to activities at the university, I write about _foundations_, with a special emphasis on the Foundations of Physics, on my blog [Fundamentae](http://fundamentae.com).

## Research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Philosophy of Science:** syntax-semantics debate, equivalence of scientific theories;
* **Foundations of Physics:** logical and philosophical investigation of physical theories;
* **Operator Algebras:** C*-algebras, mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics;
* **Dualities:** Stone-type dualities and other bridges between algebra and geometry;

## Short CV

My education trajectory until now is:

* **B.Sc. in Philosophy, UFSC (2024-current)**
  * Emphasis in Philosophical Logic and Philosophy of Science.

* **B.Sc. in Mathematics, UFSC (2018-2023)**
  * Emphasis in Mathematical Logic and Mathematical Physics.
  * Completed the [PAM honors program](http://pam.mtm.ufsc.br/).

And here are some of my current academic/professional activities:

* **Undergraduate research project in Logic and Foundations of Science, UFSC (2023-current)**
  * This research is being funded by the [PIBIC/CNPq undergraduate program](http://pibic.propesq.ufsc.br/).
  * Title: tba
  * Supervisor: Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart.
