I'm an undergraduate student in Mathematics at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) interested in research areas such as Logic, Category Theory, Operator Algebras and Foundations of Physics. Nowadays, I'm studying foundations of scientific theories under [Prof. Jonas Arenhart](https://fil.cfh.ufsc.br/jonas-becker-arenhart/)'s supervision and Stone Duality under [Prof. Luiz Cordeiro](http://mtm.ufsc.br/~cordeiro/)'s supervision. 

## More about me

Despite being an undergraduate student in Mathematics, I took many extra courses involving areas such as Philosophy, Physics and Linguistics. Among the classes I attended, for example, are Metalogic, Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Physics, Methods of Mathematical Physics, Semantics, etc.

In addition to activities at the university, I write about Mathematics, Philosophy and Foundations of Science, with a special emphasis on the Foundations of Physics, on my blog [Fundamentae](http://fundamentae.com) (in Portuguese).

## Research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Logic, Formal Methods and Mathematical Philosophy:** development of Logic and Formal Methods and its applications in Philosophy and Science in general;
* **Dualities:** Stone-type dualities and other categorical relations between algebra and geometry;
* **Operator Algebras and Mathematical Physics:** C*-algebras, mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics and related mathematical topics in contemporary Physics;
* **Philosophy and Foundations of Physics:** investigations on the nature of scientific theories, in the context of Physics, from a logical and philosophical point of view.

## Short CV

My education trajectory until now is:

* **B.Sc. in Mathematics and Scientific Computing at UFSC (2018-current)**
  * Emphasis in Logic and Mathematical Physics. 

* **Advanced Program in Mathematics at UFSC (2018-2022)** 
  *  Honours course including Introductory Analysis, Linear Algebra and Calculus on Manifolds.

And here are some of my current academic/professional activities:

* **Undergraduate research project in Logic and Foundations of Science, UFSC (2022-2023)**
  * This research is being funded by the [PIBIC/CNPq undergraduate program](http://pibic.propesq.ufsc.br/).
  * Title: tba
  * Supervisor: Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart.
