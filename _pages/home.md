I'm a Mathematical Philosophy undergraduate student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/), namely, I'm an undergraduate student in Philosophy with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics interested in research areas such as Logic, Philosophy of Science and Foundations of Physics. Nowadays, I'm studying foundations of scientific theories under [Prof. Jonas Arenhart](https://fil.cfh.ufsc.br/jonas-becker-arenhart/)'s supervision and Stone Duality under [Prof. Luiz Cordeiro](http://mtm.ufsc.br/~cordeiro/)'s supervision.

## More about me

While as an undergraduate student in Mathematics, I took many extra courses involving areas such as Philosophy, Physics and Linguistics. Among the classes I attended, for example, are Quantum Computing, Philosophy of Physics, Methods of Mathematical Physics, Semantics, etc.

In addition to activities at the university, I write about _foundations_, with a special emphasis on the Foundations of Physics, on my blog [Fundamentae](http://fundamentae.com).

## Research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Logic and Mathematical Philosophy:** formal methods and its applications to philosophical problems;
* **Dualities:** Stone-type dualities and other categorical relations between algebra and geometry;
* **Operator Algebras and Mathematical Physics:** C*-algebras, mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics and related mathematical topics in Contemporary Physics;
* **Philosophy and Foundations of Physics:** investigations on the nature of scientific theories, in the context of Physics, from a logical and philosophical point of view.

## Short CV

My education trajectory until now is:

* **B.Sc. in Philosophy, UFSC (2024-current)**
  * Emphasis in Philosophical Logic and Philosophy of Science.

* **B.Sc. in Mathematics, UFSC (2018-2023)**
  * Emphasis in Mathematical Logic and Mathematical Physics.
  * Completed the [PAM honors program](http://pam.mtm.ufsc.br/).

And here are some of my current academic/professional activities:

* **Undergraduate research project in Logic and Foundations of Science, UFSC (2023-current)**
  * This research is being funded by the [PIBIC/CNPq undergraduate program](http://pibic.propesq.ufsc.br/).
